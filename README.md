##DaVinci FW based on Repetier
============================

###no more maintened - please go to https://github.com/luc-github/Repetier-Firmware-0.92 for latest version   

This fw is based on repetier fw and modified to work with DaVinci 1.0, 2.0 single fan and 2.0. 
###It does not support latest boards generation! Check you board first!  
It works with host software like [repetier host](http://repetier.com), or as stand alone if you use a WIFI SD Card.

You can see more on [Voltivo forum](http://voltivo.com/forum/davinci-firmware).

Current firmware is based on version of  modified [repetier FW](https://github.com/repetier/Repetier-Firmware) 0.91 : [bgm370 Da Vinci 1.0 FW](https://github.com/bgm370/Repetier-Firmware) 

It gets rid off Da Vinci software and filament restrictions: it allows to use clear ABS because it allows to disable sensors, as well as others brand name filaments because it does not use cartridge chip, it allows any slicer or third-party host software usage in normal way. 

##Installation
Use arduino IDE supporting arduino DUE, [version 1.5.8+](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc3), variant.cpp need to be updated in arduino directory, the ino file is the repetier.ino located in src\ArduinoDUE\Repetier directory.
For upgrade from stock FW and revert to, please check DaVinci forum.

Do not forget to modify the configuration.h to match the targeted Da Vinci: 1.0, 2.0 SF or 2.0. 
for basic installation just change :  
'#define DAVINCI 1 // "1" For DAVINCI 1.0, "2" For DAVINCI 2.0 with 1 FAN, "3" For DAVINCI 2.0 with 2 FANS</code>'

  1 for DaVinci 1.0 (1Fan, 1 Extruder)  
  2 for DaVinci 2.0 SF (1Fan, 2 Extruders)  
  3 for DaVinci 2.0  (2Fans, 2 Extruders)  
  
  Once flash is done <B>do not forget to use M502 then M500 </B>from repetier <B>or got select printer menu "Settings/Load Fail-Safe"</B> and accept to save in eeprom to have correct eeprom settings.

##Implemented
* Standard GCODE commands
* Single/Dual extruders support (DaVinci 1.0/2.0)
* Single Fan / Dual fans support according printer configuration
* Repurpose of second fan usage to be controlled by M106/M107 commands on Da Vinci 2.0
* Sound and Light management, including powersaving function (light can be managed remotely by GCODE)
* Cleaning Nozzle(s) by menu and by GCODE for 1.0 and 2.0
* Load / Unload filament by menu
* Filament Sensor support for 1.0 and 2.0 (auto loading / alert if no filament when printing)
* Auto Z-probe for 1.0 and 2.0 
* Manual Leveling for 1.0 and 2.0 
* Dripbox cleaning
* Advanced/Easy menu (switch in "Settings/Mode" or using Up key/Right key/ Ok key in same time)
* Loading FailSafe settings
* Emergency stop (Left key/Down key/Ok key  in same time)
* Increase extruder temperature range to 270C and bed to 130C
* Add temperature control on extruder to avoid movement if too cold
* Add fast switch (1/10/100mm) for manual position/extrusion
* Several fixes from original FW
* More to come ....

##Known Issues
* Printer freeze when unplug from repetier host if no clean de-connection (hot unplug / computer go to stand by ...), one solution is there : https://github.com/luc-github/Repetier-Firmware/issues/43
